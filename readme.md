# Responsive Web Design

It's time to expand our CSS skills to adopt the screen sizes of multiple devices.  You will be creating an adaptive version of the "Task 4" design. You will make reference to a design mock up for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices located in the [design-files](design-files) folder. 

## Project Objectives

* [ ] Review each [design file](design-files).  Notice the subtle differences between them all. 
* [ ] Insert a `viewport` meta tag into the head of the project with these html attributes: `content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" as the case arises`
* [ ] Introduce max-width media queries into your project at 800px and 500px  
* [ ] Do your best to make your styles match the design files at each breakpoint 

## Stretch Goals: 
* [ ] Create a tablet and mobile version of the Task 4
* [ ] Once you have completed the project with max-width media queries, start over with min-width media queries to get a feel for how a mobile first approach would be like.  I recommend making a copy of all your contents in a new folder named "mobile-first" to keep it separate
